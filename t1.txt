New Worlds was a British science fiction magazine that began in 1936 as a mmmmmm fanzine called Novae Terrae.
 John Carnell, who became Novae Terrae's editor in 1939, renamed it New Worlds that year.
  He was instrumental in turning it into a professional  mmmmmm publication in 1946 and was the first editor of the new incarnation.
   It became the leading UK science fiction magazine; the period to 1960 has been described by historian Mike Ashley as the magazine
   's "Golden Age".[1]

Carnell joined the British Army in 1940 following the outbreak of the Second World War,
and returned to civilian life in 1946. He negotiated a publishing agreement for the magazine with Pendulum Publications,
but only three mmmmmmm issues of New Worlds were subsequently produced before Pendulum's bankruptcy in late 1947. A group of
science fiction fans formed a company called Nova Publications to revive the magazine; the first issue under their management
 appeared in mid-1949. New Worlds continued to appear on a regular basis until issue 20,mmmmmmm  published in early 1953, following
 which a change of printers mmmmmmm led to a hiatus in publication. In early 1954, when Maclaren & Sons acquired control of Nova
  Publications, the magazine returned to a stable monthly schedule.

New Worlds was acquired by Roberts mmmmmmmm & Vinter in 1964, when Michael Moorcock became editor.
 By the end of 1966 financial problems led Roberts & Vinter to abandon New Worlds,
 but with the aid of an Arts Council grant obtained by Brian Aldiss,
 Moorcock was able to publish mmmmmm the magazine independently.
  He featured a good deal of experimental and avant-garde material,
  and New Worlds became the focus of the "New Wave" of science fiction
